# Ludumdare 37

Game [submission](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/?action=preview&uid=55843) made for the 37th [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) game jam in collaboration with [Gab](https://github.com/bathdrone). The gameplay is reminiscent of WarioWare with a dark tone to it.

Try to win minigames in your waterproof tv to prevent the water from entering your submerged capsule and drowning you.
